# transit-dart

Transit is a data format and set of libraries for conveying values between
applications written in different languages. This library provides support for
marshalling Transit data to/from Dart.

* [Transit Rationale](https://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/7/22/transit)
* [Transit Specification](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format)
* [transit-dart API docs](https://pub.dev/documentation/transit_dart/latest/)

This implementation's major.minor version number corresponds to the version of
the Transit specification it supports.

_NOTE: Transit is intended primarily as a wire protocol for transferring data
between applications. If storing Transit data durably, readers and writers are
expected to use the same version of Transit and you are responsible for
migrating/transforming/re-storing that data when and if the transit format
changes._

## Releases and Dependency Information

* Latest release: 0.8.109 <!--TRANSIT_DART_VERSION-->

## Getting started

```
dart pub add transit_dart
```

Then in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:transit_dart/transit_dart.dart';
```

See [Installing](https://pub.dev/packages/transit_dart/install).

## Usage

## Testing

To run the roundtrip verification tests in `transit-format`, first ensure
Dart>=2.19.1 and Java 8 are installed, then do the following:

1. Set up a testing directory where `transit-format` and `transit-dart` can be
   cloned side-by-side. We have a fork of `transit-format` that has support for
   testing `transit-dart` all ready to go. Clone this to your test folder.

```sh
mkdir transit-test
cd transit-test
git clone https://github.com/wevre/transit-format.git
# Do something similar to the following to ensure Java 8.
jenv local 1.8
```

2. From the `transit-format` folder, run the verify command.

```sh
bin/verify -impls dart
```
